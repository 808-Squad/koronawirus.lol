# COVID-19 Restrictions Generator
This website allows you to generate the latest set of funny restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Contributions
We welcome contributions for translating the content into your native language (except for Polish and English). The content that needs to be translated is found in `public/messages/` and `public/lolcontent/`. Please do your best to ensure an adequate level of lulz, as we will not be able to verify that it is, in fact, funny.

After coming up with the data, you are welcome to open a pull request.

So far, the choice of language is based on locale - in the future we might point a different domain to the website (for other languages) and/or allow the language to be selected explicitly.
